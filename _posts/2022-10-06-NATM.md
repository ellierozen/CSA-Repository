# Presentations

## Presentation Reflection

According to Mr. Mortensen, our website was "really, really, really, good". The team was very proud of the website that we built, and we all worked very hard to make it go above and beyond the requirements. The team had the opportunity  to show our work to fellow parents and students. We explained the different parts of our website, and showed the accessibility of it. 

We also brought our own parents to look at the website we have been working on throughout the trimester. It was good to show them our progress we had made and the different features we had worked on together for the clothing website.

Overall, it was a successful night at the museum, and we are happy we put all of the hard work into it.
