title: Trimester Reflection
---

This trimester was fine for me. I had prior knowledge in coding (C#), so making it java really simple to understand. I learned more about objects, methods, contructors, classes, etc. I also learned what/how to do aws deployment. I also learned how to use github, jupyter notebooks, make posts, pull requests, issues, etc. since this was my first time in a DNHS coding class. I felt that the group that I worked with made a nice team, and we all did our fair share of work throughout projects. Our website was successful, and was enjoyed by many parents and students! I was the frontened job this trimester so I learned how to write in HTML, CSS, and learned the breakups of making a website.
