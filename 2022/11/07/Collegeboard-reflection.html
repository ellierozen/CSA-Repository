<li>a big part of this score I believe was that I got lucky on my guesses to the ones which I was unsure of. In addition to that, I did not do the mc in one sitting, which means I was in a much more relaxed enviornment than I would be for the actual AP exam. </li>

<li>k is supposed to start at 1 and then increase at increments at 1 which is one of the most obvious reasons why the answer was supposed to be A</li>

<ul>
<li>I did the recrur step twice but after I needed to keeping running through the loop until the value was less or eqaul to 10, which means I need to put 18 into the else step</li>

<li>My answer for this question was D so I am not sure how it ended up being submitted as B (probably misclick)</li>
<li>When DeMorgans law is applied the and operator turns into the or operator, and vise versa</li>
<li>My expressions in the parentheses are correct </li>

<li>I wasnt sure between 1 and 2 which one was right and wrong, but I knew 3 was not right because in order to determine fit the depth and width need to be known of the individual boxes</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I initially wanted to put E as my answer but then I realized that the very first iteration would be 1-1 so it would start with 0, and then go to 7</li>
<li>I wasn't sure between B and C but I guessed B </li>
<li>The reason why it is B is because at the end the last value is 0, which is not greater than the arr5 (10), so the loop would terminate </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I believe I had a few other problems bookmarked but the symbol goes away once submitted so it is hard to go back and see which ones I was unsure about </li>
