    "## New Vocab\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Classes \n",
    "- In Java, there are two main access levels that you will see in this course, private and public\n",
    "- When creating classes, classes should always be declared public since they need to be accessed by other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "public class car \n",
    "{\n",
    "    blah\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor \n",
    "- You use constructors to create new objects using a class\n",
    "- Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object, which should include initial values for all instance variables\n",
    "- The no-argument constructor executes anytime an object is created and sets any instant variable to their default value\n",
    "- The reason the constructor doesn't return a value is because it's not called directly by your code, it's called by the memory allocation and object initialization code in the runtime.\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "private int height; \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessor Methods \n",
    "- An accessor method is a method that is used to return the value of an instance (or static) variable to the user\n",
    "- When naming your method you should always use this format: get[Variable Name] for the name- \n",
    "Getter method Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "private int height = 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "public int getHeight()\n",
    "{\n",
    "  return height;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutator Methods\n",
    "- A mutator method is a method that is used to update the value of an instance (or static) variable\n",
    "- Mutator methods set a new value. As such, they are often referred to as setter methods\n",
    "- When creating mutator methods you should always use: set[Variable Name]\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "private int width = 10;\n",
    "\n",
    "public void setWidth(int newWidth)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  width = newWidth;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Static Methods/Class Methods\n",
    "- A class method (or static method) is a method of a class that is common to all instances of a class and is not called on any specific object instance\n",
    "- Classes can have both instance variables and static variables, but static methods can only update static variables\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "private static int getTotalBirds()\n",
    "{\n",
    "  return totalBirds;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Static Variables \n",
    "- Because static methods and variables are available across an entire class, they donâ€™t need to be called on a particular instance of the class. \n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "Skater.getTotalSkaters(); //This will call the getTotalSkaters() method on the Skater class without requiring an instance of the class to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \n",
    "- \"this\": refers to constructor being called in , references the object \n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers \n",
    "- mainly used for encapsulation and helps to prevent misuse of data public static void main string args\n",
    "- public, protected, default, private \n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "private static void \n",
    "protected void \n",
