    "I thought that trying to do it in an hour and a half was the biggest constraint of the assignment. For the questions that were harder, or that I was spending too much time on, I took my best educated guess and moved on. I am happy college board provides explainations for the wrong and write answers after they give the score back.  "

Since the original expression prints \"dog\" when a < b || c != d evaluates to true, an equivalent code segment would print \"cat\" when the negative of the expression, or !(a < b || c != d), evaluates to true. Applying De Morganâ€™s laws produces the equivalent Boolean expression a >= b && c == d for the case when \"cat\" should be printed.\n",

Code segment I produces the same output as the original code segment because the result of evaluating the expression x % 2 has only two possible values: 0 if x is even and 1 if x is odd. Code segment II produces the same output as the original code segment because the second else clause that prints \"NONE\" is never reached. Code segment III does not produce the same output as the original code segment. It creates a local boolean variable and assigns it the result of x % 2 == 0, but when using it in the if statement, the wrong branch is taken so that \"YES\" is printed for even integers and \"NO\" is printed for odd integers.\n",
