    "I enjoyed going to the extra credit opportunity and learned about the programs and CSUSM. It looks like they have a lot of buildings that are new and dedicated to STEM. I really related to Ashely when she said that she wasn't doing too hot in AP physics, and it gave me more confidence for the future. My favorite part was when I won the raffle, since I am usually not the type of person to win/get lucky. It's nice to know that CSUSM also has some women specific programs, such as the hackathon. I also learned about things that were not specific to CSUSM, such as internships. I didn't know that when you get internships in college you should go for ones that aren't unpaid. I also didn't know about subsidized vs unsubsidized loans, and I feel that this better prepared me for more financial aspects of college. "
